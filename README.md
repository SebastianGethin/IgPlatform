# IgPlatform
IG is a financial brokerage company based in Singapore. Their free trading UI is simple, but limited. I wanted to build more complex algorithms for analysing the financial data they provide, and so I created a custom IG platform.

Please note that this is not advised for use by third parties - a more comprehensive and robust platform has been built by a team of developers, and can be found at the following address:

My custom platform does not support IG's streaming service, as I do not require it for my personal financial analysis.

Please also note that this software has not yet been subjected to rigorous testing.
